/* 
Question 2: Now we need to know how the length of rental duration of these family-friendly movies compares to the duration that all movies are rented for. Can you provide a table with the movie titles and divide them into 4 levels (first_quarter, second_quarter, third_quarter, and final_quarter) based on the quartiles (25%, 50%, 75%) of the rental duration for movies across all categories? Make sure to also indicate the category that these family-friendly movies fall into.
Answer: The question is rather ambiguous about how one subset of data (duration of these family-friendly movies) should be compared to another subset of data (duration that all movies are rented for). Below I provide 3 ways to answer the above question.
