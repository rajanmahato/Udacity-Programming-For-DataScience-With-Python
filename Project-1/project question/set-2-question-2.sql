Question 2
We would like to know who were our top 10 paying customers, how many payments they made on a monthly basis during 2007, 
and what was the amount of the monthly payments. Can you write a query to capture the customer name, month and year of 
payment, and total payment amount for each month by these top 10 paying customers?
